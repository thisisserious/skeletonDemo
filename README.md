# Skeleton Demo
This assignment was intended to improve my public speaking skills, particularly around a specific technology. The goal is to research a new technology and demo it live for the class, speaking for 8-10 minutes.

I chose [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), a responsive CSS boilerplate, because I love clean and simple design and am also interested in mobile-first design. It gets bonus points for being all of those things in ~400 lines of code.
